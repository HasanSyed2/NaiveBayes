Naive Bayes Classifier
Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier along with an example of its application on synthetic data. The Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. It is particularly well-suited for classification tasks, especially when dealing with relatively simple datasets.

Contents
naive_bayes.py: This file contains the implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier, including a function naive_bayes that takes training data, training labels, and test data as input and returns the predicted labels for the test data.

example.py: An example script that generates synthetic data from two classes, trains the Naive Bayes classifier on a portion of the data, and evaluates its performance on the remaining test data. The results are visualized using matplotlib.

Usage
To use the Naive Bayes classifier on your own data, follow these steps:

Import the required libraries:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Copy the naive_bayes.py file into your project or import its contents.
Prepare your dataset. In the provided example, synthetic data is generated for two classes, and labels are assigned accordingly.
Split your data into training and testing sets. Adjust the split ratio as needed.
Call the naive_bayes function with your training and test data:
predictions = naive_bayes(train_data, train_labels, test_data)



Visualize the results using matplotlib. Feel free to customize the plot according to your dataset:
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(train_data[:, 0], train_data[:, 1], c=train_labels, cmap='viridis', marker='o', edgecolors='k', label='Training Points')
plt.scatter(test_data[:, 0], test_data[:, 1], c=predictions, cmap='viridis', marker='x', s=200, linewidths=2, label='Predictions')
plt.title('Naive Bayes Decision Boundary')
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
